Assessment Document: Domain Abuse Mitigation & Technical Solution
=================================================================

### Introduction

This document outlines a strategic approach to domain abuse mitigation, detailing the methodology for investigating and handling abuse reports. The objective is to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the entire lifecycle of a domain abuse report, from initial ingestion to final resolution.

### Part I: Triage & Policy Application

#### 1\. Triage and Prioritization

The prioritization of abuse reports is based on the potential for harm. Threats to human safety and public trust take precedence over financial fraud, which is in turn more urgent than general security threats.

*   **CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) Domains:** teen-videosxxx.pw and peach-cams.space.
    
    *   **Justification:** These reports are of the highest severity and urgency. They involve illegal content that directly harms children. The legal and moral obligation to act on these reports is paramount, and immediate mitigation is required.
        
    *   **Action:** Immediate registry action is required to suspend these domains. They cannot be simply monitored.
        
*   **Botnet C2 Domain:** updatesystem.online.
    
    *   **Justification:** A botnet Command and Control (C2) server represents a significant security threat. It controls a network of compromised machines, which can be used to launch large-scale attacks, spread malware, or conduct other malicious activities. This represents a systemic risk to the Internet.
        
    *   **Action:** This domain requires immediate suspension by the registry.
        
*   **Phishing Domains:** verify-paypal-online.online, support-chaseonline.online, and file-portal24.online.
    
    *   **Justification:** These domains are employed for financial fraud, impersonating well-known brands to steal user credentials and financial information. This causes direct financial harm to individuals and erodes public trust in the online ecosystem.
        
    *   **Action:** These domains require immediate suspension. Given the volume of reports and the registrar's (Namecheap) history, this will likely be a frequent and ongoing task.
        
*   **Malware Domain:** mailbox-update.online.
    
    *   **Justification:** This domain is used to distribute malicious software, which can compromise users' systems. While serious, it typically poses a less immediate and widespread threat than a botnet C2.
        
    *   **Action:** This domain should be immediately suspended.
        

The consistent use of hyphenated names and brand impersonation in newly registered domains indicates that they are part of a coordinated malicious campaign and necessitate a proactive, systemic response.

#### 2\. Policy Application

The ICANN policies most relevant to this scenario are Specification 6 and Specification 11 of the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA).

*   **Specification 6:** This specification is part of the base RAA and obligates registrars to provide a "WHOIS" service and to take action on abuse reports, while also obliging them to comply with all applicable laws and governmental regulations.
    
*   **Specification 11:** This is a more recent addition for new gTLDs like .online. It gives the registry operator the right to take reasonable steps to mitigate "Security Threats," which are explicitly defined to include phishing, malware, and botnets.
    

Based on these policies, the registry has clear grounds for direct action. While the initial responsibility for handling abuse reports lies with the registrar, Specification 11 provides the .online registry with the authority to suspend or lock a domain if the registrar is non-responsive or fails to take adequate action in a timely manner. Given that Namecheap has a known history of being slow to respond, the registry can justify taking direct action if the registrar's response is delayed.

### Part II: Draft Communications, Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

#### 1\. Draft Communications

**Email to NamecheapSubject:** URGENT ABUSE REPORT: Phishing Domains in .online TLD**To:** abuse@namecheap.com**CC:** abuse@whois-privacy-service.com (if applicable)

Dear Namecheap Abuse Team,

This email serves as an urgent abuse report for the following domains registered under your accreditation in the .online TLD:

*   verify-paypal-online.online
    
*   support-chaseonline.online
    
*   file-portal24.online
    

These domains have been identified as hosting phishing content that impersonates well-known brands, which is a direct violation of both your terms of service and ICANN's Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA).

We have received reports from Netcraft and our internal scanning tools confirming this malicious activity. The domains were registered between June 1st and June 3rd, 2025, and use a common pattern of hyphenated brand impersonation.

**Required Action:** We require immediate suspension of these domains within 24 hours to prevent further harm to end-users. Please confirm receipt of this report and the actions taken.

**Escalation Clause:** Please be advised that in accordance with ICANN's RAA Specification 11, the .online registry has the authority to take direct action, including domain suspension, if a registrar fails to respond or take appropriate action in a timely manner. If we do not receive a confirmation of action within our requested timeline, we will proceed with a direct suspension of the domains to protect the public.

Sincerely,\[Your Name\]Trust & Safety Analyst.online Registry

**Response to NetcraftSubject:** Re: Abuse Report - \[verify-paypal-online.online\]**To:** reports@netcraft.com**CC:** \[Your Name\]

Dear Netcraft Team,

Thank you for your report regarding the domain verify-paypal-online.online. We have received your report and are initiating our investigation.

We are taking the necessary steps to engage the registrar and ensure prompt mitigation of this threat. We appreciate your partnership in helping us maintain a secure and trustworthy namespace.

We will update you on the outcome of our investigation.

#### 2\. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

To assess whether these domains are part of a broader abuse campaign, one must look for patterns and connections between them. The observed patterns—newly registered domains, hyphenated names, and brand impersonation—are strong indicators of a coordinated campaign.

*   **Registrar and TLD Analysis:** The fact that all domains are in the .online TLD and some are from the same registrars (Namecheap and Hostinger) suggests a targeted campaign against this specific gTLD, or that the malicious actors favor these registrars due to their low costs and potential for a slow abuse response.
    
*   **Naming Convention:** The hyphenated names (verify-paypal-online, support-chaseonline) and the use of keywords like update, system, and portal are hallmarks of automated Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) used by cybercriminals.
    
*   **IP Address and Nameserver Correlation:** Even with WHOIS privacy, a DNS lookup can be performed to check the IP addresses and nameservers associated with these domains. If they resolve to the same or a limited set of IP addresses, it is a strong indicator of a single malicious actor using the same hosting infrastructure for their campaign.
    

**Investigation Steps and Tools**

*   **DNS Lookups:** Use tools like dig or online DNS lookup services to find the IP addresses and nameservers for all the reported domains.
    
*   **Passive DNS:** Use services that maintain a historical record of DNS data to see if the domains have ever resolved to the same IP addresses as other known malicious domains.
    
*   **Abuse.ch:** Check public blacklists and threat intelligence feeds like Abuse.ch, PhishTank, and Spamhaus for any of the domains or their associated IP addresses.
    
*   **WHOIS History:** Use WHOIS history services to see if the domains have been re-registered or have changed registrars, which can be an indicator of evasion.
    
*   **Domain Reputation Services:** Use commercial services like DomainTools or RiskIQ to perform a deeper analysis on the domains' reputation, history, and connections to other malicious infrastructure.
    

**Mitigation Plan (Proactive Steps)**

A proactive approach is necessary to combat these trends. The following proactive mitigation steps are recommended:

*   **Establish High-Risk Registrars:** Identify registrars, such as Namecheap in this case, that are frequently associated with abuse and have a slow response time. Prioritize communication with these registrars.
    
*   **Proactive Monitoring:** Implement a system that automatically scans for new domain registrations in .online.
    
*   **Pattern Detection Algorithms:** Develop and deploy an algorithm that automatically flags newly registered domains based on the observed patterns:
    
    *   **Keyword Matching:** Flag domains containing keywords like paypal, chase, login, verify, update, secure.
        
    *   **Naming Convention:** Flag domains that use multiple hyphens or are a combination of a brand name and a generic keyword.
        
    *   **High-Confidence Source Matching:** Instantly flag domains that are reported by trusted sources like Netcraft and IWF.
        
*   **Automated Takedown Requests:** For high-confidence reports (e.g., from IWF), automate the generation and sending of takedown requests to registrars.
    
*   **Direct Registry Action:** For high-severity abuse types like CSAM and botnets, establish a clear policy for immediate suspension of the domain by the registry, bypassing the registrar if necessary.
    

### Part III: Reflection and Reporting

#### Executive Summary

**Key Abuse Trends Observed in .online**The .online TLD is experiencing a concerning trend of targeted, high-volume abuse campaigns. The most prevalent abuse types are phishing, malware, and CSAM, with a clear pattern of malicious actors using newly registered domains that impersonate well-known brands. These domains are characterized by hyphenated naming conventions (brand-keyword.online) and utilize WHOIS privacy to conceal the actors' identities. The abuse is being reported by reputable third-party sources like Netcraft and the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), indicating a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.

**Risks Posed to Brand Reputation**This pattern of abuse poses a significant risk to the .online TLD's brand reputation. This association with abuse can lead to a perception of the TLD as "unsafe" or "high-risk," which not only deters legitimate users but also erodes public trust in the namespace. The slow response from certain registrars compounds this risk, making the TLD appear poorly managed and reactive.

**Recommendations for Ongoing Monitoring and Registrar Outreach**To combat these trends, a proactive approach is necessary. The recommendations are:

*   **Enhanced Proactive Monitoring:** Develop and deploy automated systems that use pattern detection algorithms to flag high-risk domains at the time of registration.
    
*   **Tiered Registrar Engagement:** Establish a tiered system for engaging with registrars, prioritizing those with a history of slow response or high abuse rates.
    
*   **Formal Registrar Escalation Policy:** Officially document and implement a clear escalation policy, including a timeline for registrar response, before the registry takes direct action.
    
*   **Strengthened Communication:** Maintain regular and transparent communication with key abuse-reporting partners, as their data is critical to proactive efforts.
    
*   **Technical Controls:** Explore technical mitigations such as implementing registrar-side filters to block the registration of known suspicious keywords and patterns.
